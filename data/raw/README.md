## Dataset:

This dataset is collected using 8 synchronized Intel RealSense D435i cameras, capturing multiple sequences from different viewpoints. Each sequence includes 8 distinct views, and the dataset contains a total of 5 different actions.

Annotations are provided for View 5, which were created using the VGG Annotator tool. Since all cameras are synchronized, these annotations can be directly applied to the corresponding frames in the other views, ensuring consistent labeling across all perspectives.
